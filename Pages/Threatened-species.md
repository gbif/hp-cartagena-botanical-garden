In its efforts to conserve, preserve, restore and enrich the ecosystems of the Colombian Caribbean region, the Cartagena Botanical Garden developed a project to strengthen the populations of seven threatened species of native trees in the Colombian Caribbean region by propagating and planting new individuals. The project consisted of mapping and identifying the current and potential distribution, as well as threats and suitable locations for developing planting activities. Secondly, two new local nurseries were installed and one was improved for the propagation of threatened species. Thirdly, data on phenology and regeneration of the species were collected. Finally, courses on propagation of threatened species, nursery management and planting were held for local gardeners.
